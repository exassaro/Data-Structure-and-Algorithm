# 🧠 Data Structure and Algorithm Practice

This repository contains structured practice and explanations of **core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
The work is divided into three main folders, each focused on a specific set of topics.



---

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

### 🔸 DSA 1: Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Linked list traversal, insertion, deletion, reversal
- Logical problems using linked lists
- Searching algorithms

---

### 🔸 DSA 2: Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables & Sorting
- Stack (LIFO structure)
- Queue (FIFO structure)
- Hash Table implementation and collision handling
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- Logical questions to test understanding

---

### 🔸 DSA 3: Graphs, Trees, Tries, Heaps & BST
- Graphs (using adjacency list and matrix)
- BFS and DFS traversal
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Tries (Prefix trees)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Binary Search Trees (insertion, search, deletion)
- Real-world problem solving using these structures

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This is part of my ongoing journey to build a strong foundation in problem-solving using DSA.  
It supports:
- Coding interview preparation  
- Logical thinking and algorithm development  
- Building efficient backend systems and applications

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add complexity analysis for each algorithm
- Add visual diagrams for each data structure
- Include more logical questions with explanations
- Link to LeetCode/HackerRank problems
